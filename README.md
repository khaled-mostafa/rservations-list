## Getting Started

At Yassir, restaurant owners are one of servicesâ€™ users. To help them manage
their business better,I built this interface to display the reservations,
so that they can take action on them

### Built With

-   [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   [MUI](https://mui.com/) - Material UI is a simple and customizable component library to build faster, beautiful, and more accessible React applications.
-   [React-DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) - React package for working with the DOM.
-  [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - A full fake REST API with zero coding
-  [axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - Simple and complete React DOM testing utilities
-  [react-testing-library-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/) - A library to test React hooks with react-testing-library
-  [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) - Intercept HTTP requests and mock responses

## Features

-   [x] Create json-server [mock_data] for reservations
-   [x] Display reservations list
-   [x] User can sort reservations
-   [x] User can filter reservations by status, shifts, area, and date
-   [x] User can search by name and surename
-   [x] Unit test for components and hooks
-   [x] Implement MSW for mocking API requests in tests

## Improvements and future work

-  Add more tests for components, integration tests, and e2e tests
- Add [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to handle data fetching and caching


## Prerequisites

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.15.4) >= 12.16 or higher
-   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22.10) or higher

## Project setup

1.  Clone the repository
    ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/khaled-mostafa/rservations-list.git
     ```
2.  Install yarn packages
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
3.  Run the app
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```
    this command will run also the json-server [mock_data] on port 6006 **and it is delayed by 1 second to simulate the real API**
4.  Open [http://localhost:3007](http://localhost:3007) to view it in the browser.

6. To check the json-server [mock_data] open [http://localhost:6006/reservations](http://localhost:6006/reservations)

5.  To run tests
    ```sh
    yarn test
    ```
